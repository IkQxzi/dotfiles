tutorial:

  for conciseness,
  commands are put in groups of similar, separated by slashes:
  eg: diw/W: delete word/string under cursor
  is equivalent to: 
  diw: delete word under cursor
  diW: delete string under cursor

  -ignore square brackets in execution
  -anything with esc is custom
  -spc is the default leader key for nvchad
  -some prefer caps to ctrl rather than esc, modify accordingly 

terminal:

  tldr [cmd]: display help for [cmd]
  ssha: add key (github) to ssh agent

  custom:
    esc spc: accept autocomplete
    esc t: toggle transparency
    esc x: exit; kill terminal

  3 modes: normal [esc/caps], insert [i/a/o/O], visual [v]

      spc /: comment/uncomment line

      ctrl n: open/close file nav:
        spc e: focus file nav

      ':line num': jump to line

    navigation:
      hjkl: move cursor 1 character
      b: beginning of previous word
      e: end of next word:
