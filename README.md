**My Current (WIP) Linux config:**

**Prerequisites:**
It is highly recommended to rebind Caps Lock to Esc, either by:
-using GNOME tweaks to set it system-wide
-using xmodmap in .zshrc to set it in terminal only

zsh: zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, git
nvim: undotree 

**Info**

-OS: **Ubuntu 24 LTS**
  
-Window Manager: **GNOME**
  
-Terminal: **zsh + oh-my-zsh**
  
-Editor: **nvim + nvchad**

**The main requirement for my config is to stay on the home row as much as possible, which is why:**

**Caps Lock -> Esc**

**Esc -> Leader Key**


_**Notes:**_

I have found **zsh-autosuggestions** to be more convenient (and much more responsive) than **zsh-autcomplete**.

In future, I might try out:

  **-tmux** for easier Python input handling, (though for now terminal in nvim is adequate)
  
  **-i3** for the workspaces.
